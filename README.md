# Password-Generator---Chrome-Extension

I created this google chrome extension to solve my own horrible habit of using the same password for every account I made online. Then after talking with those who were more knowledgeable about the cybersecurity field, I learned of the privacy issues that can ensue which is why I created this product that can be enjoyed by all.

### Languages I used:

  * Javascript
  * HTML
  * CSS
  
### Something I learned:

  * In order to allow users to save their file on their computer, I incorporated filesaver.js which is credited to: https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/
  
  Here is a short gif that shows my extension in action:
